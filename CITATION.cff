  This software assembles raw data (also provided)
  and applies metadata to data collected from a
  two-site study (Berkeley and Dar-es-Salaam) on
  rationality in decisions involving uncertainty. The
  scripts are written in Stata, and an explanation of
  how they are run using the AEA Stata docker
  container is supplied.
